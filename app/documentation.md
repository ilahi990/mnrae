Task 1: Laravel Project Local Environment Setup

Problem:
When the project was handed over, the index.php file and .htaccess file were placed in the root directory instead of the public folder. This caused errors when attempting to set up and run the project in the local environment, as Laravel’s default structure requires these files to be located in the public directory for proper routing and security.

Solution:
I moved the index.php and .htaccess files to Laravel’s default public folder. Additionally, I created a new .htaccess file in the root directory to handle rewrite rules. This configuration ensured that the project worked correctly in both the local development environment and the production environment.

Impact:
The project can now run seamlessly across both local and production environments without routing issues, following Laravel’s best practices and improving maintainability.

Task 2: Asset Path Fix for CSS, JS, and Images

Problem:
After setting up the project locally, none of the CSS, JavaScript, or image files were loading. This was caused by incorrect paths in the Laravel asset() helper function — the paths included a hardcoded public/ prefix. it was working on production but in future it could cause the problem as i faced while setting up on local. Since Laravel’s asset() helper automatically references the public directory, this extra prefix was breaking file loading in the local environment.

Solution:
I reviewed the entire codebase and removed the hardcoded public/ prefix from all asset paths, which involved updating over 100 occurrences. This ensured that the asset() helper generated correct URLs for resources without redundancy.

Impact:
Static assets (CSS, JS, and images) now load properly in both local and production environments, improving the project’s visual consistency and functionality across setups.
Task 3: Git Repository Setup and Code Versioning

Problem:
Previously, there was no Git repository for the project. All code retrieval and updates were managed directly through cPanel, which made version control, collaboration, and deployment inefficient and risky.

Solution:
After completing the local setup and improvements, I initialized a new Git repository and pushed the updated codebase to it. This allows the project code to be cloned or updated directly from Git, eliminating the need to manually interact with cPanel for code management.

Impact:
The project now benefits from proper version control, easier collaboration, and faster deployment. This setup ensures that future code changes can be tracked, managed, and deployed more efficiently.

Task 4: Removal of Unused Header Buttons

Problem:
Each page header contained two buttons — “Add Listing” and “Login” — that were not currently functional or relevant to the project’s present requirements. Keeping unused UI elements can confuse users and clutter the interface.

Solution:
I removed both buttons from all page headers, keeping the layout clean and reserving space for future implementation if needed.

Impact:
The user interface is now cleaner and more focused, improving the overall user experience and preventing confusion caused by inactive or irrelevant features.

Task 5: Homepage Responsiveness and Layout Fixes

Problem:
On desktop, the homepage was not responsive. The text over the main video was overlapping and causing the search banner to collapse into the next section, making it partially hidden. Additionally, the HTML code contained improperly handled comments, missing closing tags, and unnecessary code, which disrupted the page structure and styling. Some HTML code was even visible on the screen. The search banner, which contains three dropdowns, also had usability issues — the dropdowns were not scrollable, preventing users from seeing all available options.

Solution:
I cleaned up the HTML by removing unnecessary code, fixing missing closing tags, and removing visible HTML fragments. I adjusted the homepage’s overall styling to ensure proper responsiveness and visibility of the search banner. The dropdown menus within the banner were improved by setting appropriate height and width constraints and adding scrolling functionality. I also ensured full mobile responsiveness for the homepage, addressing one of the main usability issues.

Impact:
The homepage is now fully responsive across desktop and mobile devices. The search banner is always visible, dropdown menus are fully accessible, and the page layout is clean and free from structural errors. This significantly improves the site’s usability and overall presentation.
